# Carmac timer PoC

This is a simply program to track time spent on deep work (hacking, learning a
language, research, etc). It is inspired by the following anecdote.

> I remember Carmack talking about productivity measurement. While working he
> would play a CD, and if he was not being productive, he'd pause the CD player.
> This meant any time someone came into his office to ask him a question or he
> checked email he'd pause the CD player. He'd then measure his output for the
> day by how many times he played the CD (or something like that -- maybe it was
> how far he got down into his CD stack). I distinctly remember him saying "So
> if I get up to go to the bathroom, I pause the player".

## How it works

1) When you launch the program it starts a timer
2) If you press space the timer pauses
3) If you press space again the timer resumes

That's it!
